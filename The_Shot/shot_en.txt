A. S. Pushkin. Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin
                  THE SHOT

"We were having a shooting match."
                     Baratynsky

"I swore to shoot him according to the rules of dueling (I still had my shot)."
                     Evening at a Bivouac

I

We were stationed in the town of ***. The life of an army officer is well known. In the morning there was drill and riding school; dinner with the regimental commander or at a Jewish tavern; in the evening punch and cards. In *** there was not a single open house, not a single marriageable girl; we gathered at each other's quarters, where, except for our uniforms, we saw nothing.

Only one man belonged to our society without being military. He was about thirty-five years old, and we therefore regarded him as an old man. Experience gave him many advantages over us; besides, his habitual gloominess, stern character and sharp tongue had a strong influence on our young minds. A certain mystery surrounded his fate; he seemed Russian, but bore a foreign name. Once he had served in the hussars, and even successfully; no one knew the reason that had prompted him to retire and settle in a poor little town, where he lived both poorly and extravagantly: he always went on foot in a worn black frock coat, but kept open table for all our officers. True, his dinner consisted of two or three courses, prepared by a retired soldier, but champagne flowed like a river. No one knew either his fortune or his income, and no one dared ask him about it. He had books, mostly military, and novels. He gladly lent them out, never asking for them back; on the other hand, he never returned to the owner a book he had borrowed. His chief exercise consisted in pistol shooting. The walls of his room were all riddled with bullets, all full of holes like a honeycomb. A rich collection of pistols was the only luxury of the poor cottage where he lived. The skill to which he had attained was incredible, and if he had offered to shoot a pear off anyone's cap among us, no one in our regiment would have hesitated to place his head at his disposal. Conversation among us often concerned duels; Silvio (as I shall call him) never mixed in such talk. When asked whether he had ever had occasion to fight, he answered dryly that he had, but never went into details, and it was evident that such questions were unpleasant to him. We supposed that some unfortunate victim of his terrible skill lay on his conscience. However, it never occurred to us to suspect anything resembling cowardice in him. There are people whose mere appearance removes such suspicions from them. An unexpected incident amazed us all.

Once about ten of our officers were dining at Silvio's. They drank as usual, that is, a great deal; after dinner we began urging our host to hold the bank for us. He long refused, for he almost never played; finally he ordered cards to be brought, poured out some fifty gold pieces on the table and sat down to deal. We surrounded him, and the game began. Silvio had the habit, when playing, of maintaining complete silence, never arguing or explaining himself. If a punter happened to miscalculate, he would immediately either pay the deficit or deduct the excess. We knew this and didn't interfere with his way of managing things; but among us was an officer who had recently been transferred to us. He, playing that same evening, absent-mindedly turned down one card too many. Silvio took the chalk and according to his custom corrected the score. The officer, thinking that he had made an error, began to explain. Silvio silently continued dealing. The officer, losing patience, took the brush and erased what seemed to him unnecessarily recorded. Silvio took the chalk and recorded again. The officer, heated by wine, the game, and the laughter of his comrades, considered himself cruelly insulted, and in a rage seized a brass candlestick from the table and hurled it at Silvio, who barely managed to dodge the blow. We were dismayed. Silvio rose, pale with anger, and with sparkling eyes said:

"My dear sir, be so good as to leave, and thank God that this happened in my house."

We did not doubt the consequences and already considered our new comrade as good as dead. The officer left, saying that he was ready to answer however it might please the banker. The game continued for several more minutes; but feeling that our host was not disposed for play, we left one after another and went to our quarters, discussing the imminent vacancy.

The next day, at drill, we looked to see whether the poor lieutenant was pale. But he appeared as usual, cheerful and carefree. We awaited the outcome. The hour appointed for the duel arrived; the lieutenant was still alive. A week passed, a month—he was still alive as before.

We were amazed. Silvio enjoyed the reputation of an excellent shot; but now evil tongues began to say that he was not as brave as he was skillful, hinting that despite his skillful handling of the pistol, he lacked courage. However, such suspicions were expressed cautiously; after all, Silvio knew how to hit his target. But once we were all puzzled. Count B*** came to us from Petersburg. We showed him the local sights, including Silvio's skill at target shooting. "Ah!" said the count. "Well, tell me about this Silvio. Has he ever had occasion to fight?" "Not at all, your excellence," we answered, "he is a peaceful man." "How peaceful! But I remember that he once killed a man in a duel." We surrounded the count, begging him to tell us everything in detail. The count knew Silvio under another name and told us the following...

II

"About five years ago," began the count, "I lived in Petersburg and knew a man... however, there's no need to name him. He was very rich, handsome, intelligent, charming, had many women at his feet—in a word, a man whom fate favored too much. At twenty he was already a guards officer. Note that he had never fought a duel, because he was too happy to expose himself to danger, and too conceited to endure insults. Everyone envied him; ill-wishers rejoiced at each of his failures, which, however, were very few. Once, at a ball at some important dignitary's house, he insulted me... no, not me, but a man whom everyone knew. This man was also very brave and skilled at shooting. A challenge followed. They fought. My friend was killed on the spot."

Everyone looked at Silvio, who listened to the count in silence, with downcast eyes.

"The man who was killed," continued the count, "was a fine young man. He was called..." And here the count looked at Silvio, but Silvio did not raise his eyes; it was evident that he was upset.

"The killer," continued the count, "immediately resigned his commission. He settled somewhere in the wilderness and continues, as I hear, to lead a gloomy and solitary life."

We all understood. We looked at poor Silvio, who in our eyes had become the hero of a novel. We surrounded him; but he continued to remain silent as before.

There was no mistake: Silvio was the killer.

After supper, when the guests had gone, I remained alone with Silvio.

"Is what the count told true?" I asked.

Silvio did not answer for a long time.

"True," he said finally. "I killed a man... in a duel."

"Who was he?"

"Count ***."

I was amazed.

"Count ***!" I exclaimed. "Forgive me! But Count *** is alive."

"Alive?" Silvio repeated. "Yes, he is alive. About six years have passed..."

"Six years!" I cried. "But the count said..."

"The count was mistaken," Silvio interrupted me. "I did not kill Count ***. I had a duel with him and did not kill him. Do you want to know how it was?"

I nodded my head.

"We fought," began Silvio. "I had the first shot. I fired and missed. The count was to shoot. Suddenly he said that he did not want to shoot—that the duel was over. I said that I did not agree—that the duel should continue until one of us was killed. But the count stood his ground. We parted. I swore revenge. For six years now I have been seeking him—and finally I have learned where he is."

"And you want to renew the duel?"

"Not exactly. Then I was satisfied with one shot; he still has his shot. Now I have come to receive my shot."

"And if he refuses?"

"That is his business. I shall fulfill my duty."

"And if he kills you?"

"And if he kills me? I am only risking a life that has become tiresome to me."

The next day Silvio received a letter and immediately began preparing for his journey.

"Farewell," he said to me. "Remember me when the occasion arises and do not judge me too harshly."

He wanted to leave without saying goodbye to anyone; but I persuaded him at least to bid farewell to our mutual friends. We went to ***. Silvio told them his story and announced his intention. Everyone was amazed.

"What!" they said. "You are going to fight with a man whom you saw six years ago, over some old offense? This is strange. This cannot be."

"I gave my word," answered Silvio.

Nothing more could be gotten out of him. Three days later he left.

Several years passed. Military service took me to other places. I often thought about the strange man, about his remarkable oath and its fulfillment. Finally fate brought me together with Count ***. It happened like this...

III

I retired and settled in the country. Never shall I forget the two months that I spent in complete solitude. The library of my late uncle, consisting mostly of novels of the eighteenth century, was my only resource. I reread Richardson and Rousseau, Kotzebue and Marmontel, "Natalya the Boyar's Daughter" and "The Cadet." The shelves were full of works by French encyclopedists. I wanted to engage in serious reading; but nothing would stick in my head. In summer the management of the estate distracted me; but with the onset of the rainy autumn I was perforce shut up in the house.

November found me in this condition. Rising late, I would walk about the rooms until dinner or sit in the library, trying to read; in the evening I would sit by the fireplace and play old maid with Varvara Ivanovna, my uncle's housekeeper, who had remained with me. Varvara Ivanovna was a most worthy woman, but talking with her was as boring as with Scheherazade, except that her stories were less entertaining.

In early November the weather changed. The sky became overcast with clouds, the roads deteriorated; I sat by the window and looked at the yellow fields and at the trees from which the wind tore the last leaves; the village was hateful to me. I awaited winter, field work, stud farming, falcon hunting.

Meanwhile neighbors arrived. The family consisted of a husband about thirty-two years old, a tall, slender brunette, and a wife about eighteen, a small blonde. Her husband introduced himself to me as Count ***. His face seemed familiar to me. We began talking; he told stories very entertainingly. It was evident that he had seen much and experienced much. In half an hour I felt completely at ease with this charming man. The countess was also very sweet, though much younger than her husband; but they seemed to be very happy with each other.

The count left the same day; the countess remained for three more days. We became close friends. She was very curious and questioned me about my life in the country, about the neighbors, about hunting. And I in turn questioned her about Petersburg, about the court. Time passed unnoticed. I grew fond of this dear, trusting countess, and she seemed to become attached to me.

On Thursday, early in the morning, the count came for his wife. They left. I felt sad, but a week later I received a letter from the countess from ***. She invited me to visit her. I hesitated for a long time; finally I decided to go. Two days later I was in ***. The countess met me on the porch. The count was away, and she expected him only in the evening. We spent the day tête-à-tête. The countess was in excellent spirits. Never had I seen her more charming. In the evening the count arrived, but it was evident that he was not in good humor. He was bored, answered dryly, and soon went to his study. The countess was worried and several times started to say something to me, but stopped. I noticed her anxiety, but did not dare to question her.

The next day the count left early in the morning for town on business and was to return for supper. The countess was sad. After breakfast we sat in the drawing room. The countess played the piano; I leafed through an album. Suddenly we were handed a calling card. The footman announced:

"Silvio wishes to see the count."

The countess turned pale.

"Call him in," she said in a barely audible voice.

The footman left.

"Do you know this man?" I asked the countess.

"I know him," she answered. "The count told me... Tell me... is it really true that he killed a man?"

"True," I answered, surprised by her words and their connection. "But whom did he kill?"

The countess did not answer. I heard footsteps.

"Is the count at home?" asked a familiar voice, and Silvio entered.

"No," answered the countess, barely breathing. "The count is in town... but he will return presently. Won't you please wait?"

"If you please," said Silvio and sat down.

We were silent. Silvio was calm; the countess was in great agitation. She rose from the piano, went to the window, then sat down again. Finally she turned to me:

"Won't you take a walk in the garden? The weather is beautiful."

Obviously, she wanted to remain alone with Silvio. I bowed and went out.

I walked in the garden for about half an hour. Then I returned to the house through the same door. The countess was sitting on the sofa; Silvio stood leaning against the mantelpiece. The countess's face was pale; her hand was visibly trembling. Silvio was frowning.

"The count will surely be here soon?" he asked.

"Surely," answered the countess.

"And I must go," said Silvio. "Farewell, countess."

He bowed and left without looking at me.

We remained alone. The countess was ready to faint.

"My God!" she exclaimed. "Do you know why he came?"

"No," I answered.

"He came... oh, this is terrible!.. He came to kill my husband."

I was amazed.

"Countess! What are you saying?"

"It's true, true!" she repeated through tears. "And I know why. Six years ago my husband slapped him, and they were to fight; but then something reconciled them—I don't know what. Silvio did not forgive this. I heard him swear revenge; now he has found us... Oh, I feel that he did not come for nothing!"

"But surely the count can defend himself!"

"Oh, this is terrible! He knows that Silvio never misses. Oh my God! What will happen, what will happen!"

She began to cry. I tried to calm her, assuring her that the count would probably take precautionary measures; but in my heart I agreed with her. A man who could calmly aim at a cherry on a cap would undoubtedly hit a human target.

"He said that he would come again tomorrow," added the countess. "If the count agrees... Oh God! Oh God!"

I spent a terrible evening. The next morning the count arrived. I told him everything.

His indifference annoyed me.

"What a nuisance!" he said. "Just now, when I am so happy! However, there's nothing to be done."

He went to his wife. I heard their long conversation. The count came out to breakfast calm and cheerful.

At eleven o'clock a carriage drove up. The count said goodbye to his wife, who fainted, kissed me, and drove off.

I remained with the countess. She was more dead than alive. Toward evening a servant of the count arrived with news that the count was well and would be home for supper.

"Thank God!" exclaimed the countess. "And Silvio?"

"There's no sign of him," answered the servant.

In the evening the count arrived. I rushed to him with questions.

"Everything is finished," he said. "Silvio is satisfied. Here, listen to what happened."

We sat down, and the count told the following:

"I arrived at the appointed place exactly at twelve. Silvio was already there. We bowed to each other. The second measured off twelve paces. I was to shoot first; but the agitation of anger was so strong in me that I did not trust the steadiness of my hand and yielded the first shot to Silvio: he did not refuse. We took our places. I stood in the corner of the room, covering my face with my cap, and prepared myself. Silvio stood opposite me, raised his pistol... I counted the seconds... I thought of her... A terrible minute passed. Silvio lowered his hand.

"'It's a pity,' he said, 'the pistol is not loaded with cherry stones... the bullet is heavy. It still seems to me that this is not a duel, but murder: I am not used to aiming at an unarmed man. Let us begin again; let us cast lots for who shoots first.'

"My head was spinning... I think I objected... Finally we loaded the pistols; we crumbled chalk, put the pieces in a cap; I drew the first number and again had precedence.

"'You are fortunate, count,' said Silvio. 'Shoot, but remember that if you do not kill me, then I will not miss—I swear on my honor.'

"His words were terrible. I aimed... and fired. Thank God, I missed: the bullet hit the painting.

"'Now it's your turn,' said Silvio. 'Confess, count, that you don't want to die. I see that you are upset...'

"This was true. My hand trembled, my legs gave way. Silvio sat on the table on which the pistols stood and began eating cherries.

"'Why don't you shoot?' I asked.

"'You don't want to? Well, as you wish; it's my time; I can shoot when I want. But I want you to fire once more.'

"'I refuse.'

"'Count!' said Silvio, rising. 'You will shoot, or I will shoot you like a dog.'

"'I will not shoot,' I repeated. 'If you want, shoot me yourself.'

"Silvio looked at me...

"'You are not afraid of death?' he asked. 'Good! You have managed to maintain your dignity. This makes me glad. I am satisfied: I have seen your confusion, your fear; I forced you to shoot at me; that is enough for me. Will you remember me? Will you respect my memory?'

"'I will,' I answered.

"'Excellent. Now we are even.'

"Silvio started to leave; at the door he turned around, aimed at the painting I had shot through, fired and disappeared. His bullet hit exactly where mine had been."

The count fell silent. Thus I learned the end of the story whose beginning had once so struck me. I never met its hero again.
